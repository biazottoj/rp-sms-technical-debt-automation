}","To solve the above problems, we propose DebtFree, a two-mode framework based on unsupervised learning for identifying SATDs. In mode1, when the existing training data is unlabeled, DebtFree starts with an unsupervised learner to automatically pseudo-label the programming comments in the training data. In contrast, in mode2 where labels are available with the corresponding training data, Debt Free starts with a pre-processor that identifies the highly prone SATDs from the test dataset.",DebtFree
